It is unclear what the exact capabilities of the product are but based on one comment from Google, it helps with tasks like headlines and modifying writing styles. Amidst fears of what impact this could have on journalist jobs, Google quickly put out a : New York Times reported Google clarifying statement Our goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity. Quite simply these tools are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating, and fact-checking their articles. This has sparked a heated conversation about the future of news with generative AI. The companies making AI products argue that this technology will enable media organizations and journalists to be more effective, while critics contend that it could potentially harm journalist jobs, increase misinformation, and flood the market with low-quality AI-generated content. In this piece, we unpack the by exploring a few things: impact of generative AI on the future of news Types of news articles today by complexity The business of news The anatomy of producing a news article What generative AI can and cannot do well Generative AI and the Future of News — A tale of two worlds Types of news articles today by complexity There are several types of news content on the internet, each with varying levels of complexity in their production. The complexity typically arises from factors like timeliness, the amount of research required, and the story being told. The low-complexity articles include: Factual/data news (eg. article listing mortgage rates in San Francisco, article with numbers from a company’s earnings call) — these are relatively straightforward with minimal subjective opinions or perspectives. Interest-based/informational news (eg. summer recipes published on NY Times Cooking, an article explaining what the Fed interest rate means) — there is some creativity in selecting topics but the focus is more informational and catering to specific interests. Breaking news (eg. an article about a CEO resigning, an article describing an active weather event) — these are typically short articles about a rapidly unfolding event, with limited initial information and emerging facts. The include: high-complexity articles News coverage (with context, research, and facts) — these provide a more detailed explanation of news backed by research, additional context, and often interviews with people, thereby requiring more time and effort to produce; they are also extensively fact-checked. Interpretive news — this includes opinion pieces, op-eds, and analyses (like this one) that provide interpretations/perspectives/opinions on current issues; they are often subjective and require extensive research to back up the perspectives. Feature pieces — these are typically deep dives on topics that might not really be hot news right now but important issues, investigative journalism would fall in this category; these require extensive research and interviews spanning across months, and also creative storytelling. I bring up this categorization because the purpose behind and process involved in producing these two types of articles is very different, and consequently will evolve differently with the use of generative AI. With this in mind, let’s talk about how news makes money. The business of news The business of news is tricky — most news organizations operate on an ad-supported media model, and a small subset have successfully managed to pivot to subscriptions. This has major implications for the type of content a news organization produces. The businesses (NYTimes notably now gets from subscriptions) have a content strategy that’s tied directly to consumer value — focus on to make the subscription worthwhile. For example, of the types of content above, NYT primarily does news coverage (that is well-researched), interpretive news, and feature pieces for their core news offering, backed up by interest-based content like and . Some other publications like the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have made strides with subscriptions using a similar approach. subscription-based news ~70% of revenue high-quality content + diverse interest-based content NYT Cooking Wirecutter However, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. This means that they are focused on generating high engagement: more eyeballs → more ad inventory → more revenue. The strategy that has been more effective for them is (like news coverage, interpretive news) (like factual/data news, interest-based/informational news). most publications are still ad-supported augmenting high-complexity content with a ton of high volume, low-complexity content This strategy works because high-complexity content helps deliver long-term value to consumers, while the ton of low-complexity content helps . The SEO loop looks something like: high volume of content that gets clicks → search engines think your content is valuable → all of your content gets ranked higher → more eyeballs. get eyeballs as well as win the SEO game This is no criticism of the strategy and the need to play the SEO game is a necessity for ad-supported media. The reality is that — the internet disrupted how content was created and distributed (mostly through Google Search / today), and news organizations have not recovered from the impact of that disruption. There are attempts to fix the imbalance, which are still evolving — Canada/Australia passed laws that force Google/Meta to pay what’s essentially a “disruptor tax” to support good journalism, some organizations like NPR are partially supported by , and some newspapers like the Washington Post are . news media is a terrible business Meta federal funding subsidized by (generally well-meaning) billionaires All this to say — news media/journalism is an absolutely essential public utility for a well-functioning democracy but a not-so-great business. Therefore, the more self-reliant these news businesses can be (without having to depend on regulation or billionaires), the more effective they can be towards achieving their mission. Generative AI can’t solve all of these structural challenges (especially content distribution) but it can definitely make content creation more efficient without necessarily compromising on quality. The anatomy of producing a news article To understand what part of news production will generative AI have the most impact on, it’s helpful to understand the different steps involved in getting a news article published. We can break down the effort into a few sequential components: Research — finding a topic, gathering facts/data, talking to the right people for quotes or perspectives Storytelling — making sense of the research to come up with a compelling storyline Writing — turning the storyline into actual words that make an article, buttoning up the storyline, backing it up with the right data / adding supporting links Editing — improving the writing, coming up with catchier headlines, having better visuals, and fact-checking to meet standards Distribution — publishing, and distributing across channels like social media. Based on some research and also influenced by my writing experience, I estimate the effort of producing an article into something like: . Take the actual numbers with a grain of salt but they are directionally accurate. Research (30%), Storytelling (20%), Writing (20%), Editing (20%), and Distribution (10%) Now, note that — the low-complexity pieces might not need to rigorously go through all steps in the life cycle above but the high-complexity pieces do. not all formats of news articles require all of the steps As an example, this article took me ~8–9 hours to finish (so did most other articles on ), and I would like to think that my articles fall under interpretive news. If I wrote a low-complexity piece, I could probably get it done in ~2 hours. Another data point — says he can typically get a news article done in a couple of hours while a feature piece might take up to 6 months. my Substack newsletter this NYT reporter So, what can generative AI actually help with? It basically comes down to what steps in the news production process can current (and future) products do well. What generative AI can and cannot do well Here’s my take on each step. Spoiler — they are somewhat effective for writing and editing, they can be effective for research if the right products are built, and they will continue to be bad at storytelling. Research — surprisingly low capability Most current generative AI products (like ChatGPT, and Google Bard) have surprisingly low capability when it comes to Research: There are definitely certain capabilities that they are good at. For example, they are good at giving arguments for a particular point of view or providing inspiration for new topics. They are average-to-good at summarizing content and in particular, answering questions based on reading an article. For example, you can ask them to read this article and list out different steps involved in news production. However, they often produce (“hallucinations”), to what they claim is the truth, and have questionably sourced data with potential copyright infringement. See the screenshot below. factually incorrect information do not provide links/sources For a generic use case (say you want to draft an email to a future LinkedIn connection), these issues don’t matter. But when you are writing a news article, not fact-checking can severely impair your brand perception. Though the research tools can be used for directionally useful research (for example, you want to know how much market share Bing and Yahoo search have), writers/journalists still have to do additional work to find a new source to link because current tools neither provide links nor have fully accurate data. for anyone building a research product for writers, and it’s very likely that new companies will emerge here. Using cleanly sourced data + being able to provide answers with trustworthy links is a big opportunity Storytelling — low capability Generative AI’s storytelling capabilities are fairly weak today. Here’s an example: I did a bunch of research for this article, put together the research in an organized format, and asked ChatGPT to give me a storyline. See the screenshot below for results. At first glance, it looks like they “make sense”. But that’s literally all it is — it makes sense at a surface level. In reality, none of these storylines are very compelling and the research notes I provided had much more detail and nuance beyond the surface-level results provided here. You can make the argument that these are still decent, but in the context of writing an article, this was completely useless to me — at best, this was inspiration/ideas, not a storyline based on the research I submitted. If you have a low-complexity story, it will get the job done for you. If you are building a nuanced story, or have the data and need help constructing a story, current products do not get the job done. Given the high amount of subjectivity involved, I am not bullish it will get better and this will continue to be the part where writers can add the most value. Writing — medium capability If you provide current products with a detailed storyline of what you want to say, it can generate a barely decent v1 of the content. The output is still pretty cookie-cutter and it is pretty challenging to instruct the current models to craft the language in a way that it tells a story. See the screenshot for an example output after I fed ChatGPT detailed notes about the storyline for this article. At first glance, you might think it looks okay for a v1 draft. It is not — the tone isn’t right, the story doesn’t flow and it always looks like it’s been written by a bot. It’s very generic and does not articulate the story despite being fed a very specific narrative. If I published that article, you would not read it. And that’s the challenge with the writing capability today — it can work for low-complexity articles but for anything more complex, you essentially have to rewrite the whole draft. — writers don’t want to take terrible cookie-cutter versions and redo the whole thing line by line. What they would like is some form of a user interaction construct that lets a writer feed in a storyline and sequentially craft the article section by section, while giving active feedback to the AI tool. Cherry on top would be being able to customize the writing style by feeding past articles written by the same writer. The big product unlock here would be enabling effective human instruction I think the underlying models today do have the capability to do this and there is , which I believe will happen near-term. innovation needed at the UI layer Editing — medium capability Tools today have a good amount of capability to review articles, find errors and make corrections. These tools are also very good at cosmetic tasks, like coming up with ideas for catchy headlines or section titles that might perform well. However, there is still work needed at the UI layer to make this usable for editing — there are some partial solutions today like which lets you improve language and make sentences shorter / longer from within a Notion page, but it does not capture the full context of the page. ChatGPT does a good job of making edits across a full article but lacks the ability to take instructions to easily edit specific sections and also cannot support links (i.e. I give it a blurb with text that has hyperlinks, I get back text without any links). Notion AI I absolutely hate the editing part of the writing process, and I am sure several writers and journalists do as well — generative AI can most definitely minimize some of this editing grunt work near-term. Distribution — medium capability There are tools coming up here today that for example help you generate social snippets, or identify parts of your story that might go more viral. This will likely continue getting better in the future. Generative AI and the future of News — A tale of two worlds Based on the above analysis, you can see a clear duality emerging: , which require simpler research &amp; storytelling, and can be written &amp; edited easily, will start to be (or heavily AI-assisted). Low-complexity formats more and more AI-generated , which require more complex research and storytelling capabilities that don’t exist today, will but generative AI can bring a good amount of High-complexity formats continue to be primarily created by journalists efficiency by minimizing writing and editing gruntwork. While AI-generated low-complexity content seems bad at first glance, these articles are primarily written for SEO purposes or to augment existing high-quality content, and the race to commoditization had started much before the generative AI wave. For example, the Associated Press has been using since 2014. The upside here — this is not the kind of content journalists want to spend time creating and automating this will free up their time for high-complexity content. bots to publish articles reporting company earnings More and more high-complexity content will emerge. Research and storytelling capabilities with products today are limited, which means that the ability to . This, accelerated by AI writing and editing tools that take the grunt work out of publishing quality content, will be a big boon for journalists. construct a compelling story based on information and story-tell in a unique way will continue to be the biggest currency journalists have What about some of the concerns raised around using AI for news? Some are fair but I believe they are mostly solvable: A wave of junk SEO content — Google has that they won’t penalize AI-generated content and have gotten criticism for opening up a world of junk content, including factually incorrect articles. That’s a somewhat fair critique but I believe Google will crack down on this — not out of the goodness of their hearts but because the crux of a search product is to give users useful results. Google already has penalties for SEO hacking practices (like keyword stuffing, and link farming) and it would be easy to extend this framework to AI content. taken the stance Journalists will lose jobs — Some have brought up the concern that journalists might lose jobs, or be in a less advantageous position (like writers in Hollywood who are currently on strike); the big difference here is that while there are a large number of writers in Hollywood, newsroom employment in the US since 2008, not because we don’t need journalists but because news is a bad business; Generative AI can help fix the economics of the business while continuing to empower journalists do what they love. has fallen 26% Conclusion I am by no means an AI maximalist and I absolutely think there are real risks to AI that need to be addressed as we scale the technology. However, I think it’s important to analyze every AI-impacted market/situation separately and not bundle them into one big AI-impact problem. In the case of news, generative AI can tremendously improve the economics of news businesses. The products are not there today — there is a clear need for AI products that thoughtfully solve writers’ needs without a brute-force, chat-based, language model interface, but I’m confident these will emerge near-term. Low-complexity writing will be more and more AI generated and that’s okay — it can help companies run an efficient SEO machine, while journalists (assisted by AI for grunt work) bring to life a lot more high complexity content that elevates the public discourse.

week, the that is testing an AI tool that enables news organizations to create content using AI. It is unclear what the exact capabilities of the product are but based on one comment from Google, it helps with tasks like headlines and modifying writing styles. Amidst fears of what impact this could have on journalist jobs, Google quickly put out a : New York Times reported Google clarifying statement Our goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity. Quite simply these tools are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating, and fact-checking their articles. This has sparked a heated conversation about the future of news with generative AI. The companies making AI products argue that this technology will enable media organizations and journalists to be more effective, while critics contend that it could potentially harm journalist jobs, increase misinformation, and flood the market with low-quality AI-generated content. In this piece, we unpack the by exploring a few things: impact of generative AI on the future of news Types of news articles today by complexity The business of news The anatomy of producing a news article What generative AI can and cannot do well Generative AI and the Future of News — A tale of two worlds Types of news articles today by complexity There are several types of news content on the internet, each with varying levels of complexity in their production. The complexity typically arises from factors like timeliness, the amount of research required, and the story being told. The low-complexity articles include: Factual/data news (eg. article listing mortgage rates in San Francisco, article with numbers from a company’s earnings call) — these are relatively straightforward with minimal subjective opinions or perspectives. Interest-based/informational news (eg. summer recipes published on NY Times Cooking, an article explaining what the Fed interest rate means) — there is some creativity in selecting topics but the focus is more informational and catering to specific interests. Breaking news (eg. an article about a CEO resigning, an article describing an active weather event) — these are typically short articles about a rapidly unfolding event, with limited initial information and emerging facts. The include: high-complexity articles News coverage (with context, research, and facts) — these provide a more detailed explanation of news backed by research, additional context, and often interviews with people, thereby requiring more time and effort to produce; they are also extensively fact-checked. Interpretive news — this includes opinion pieces, op-eds, and analyses (like this one) that provide interpretations/perspectives/opinions on current issues; they are often subjective and require extensive research to back up the perspectives. Feature pieces — these are typically deep dives on topics that might not really be hot news right now but important issues, investigative journalism would fall in this category; these require extensive research and interviews spanning across months, and also creative storytelling. I bring up this categorization because the purpose behind and process involved in producing these two types of articles is very different, and consequently will evolve differently with the use of generative AI. With this in mind, let’s talk about how news makes money. The business of news The business of news is tricky — most news organizations operate on an ad-supported media model, and a small subset have successfully managed to pivot to subscriptions. This has major implications for the type of content a news organization produces. The businesses (NYTimes notably now gets from subscriptions) have a content strategy that’s tied directly to consumer value — focus on to make the subscription worthwhile. For example, of the types of content above, NYT primarily does news coverage (that is well-researched), interpretive news, and feature pieces for their core news offering, backed up by interest-based content like and . Some other publications like the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have made strides with subscriptions using a similar approach. subscription-based news ~70% of revenue high-quality content + diverse interest-based content NYT Cooking Wirecutter However, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. This means that they are focused on generating high engagement: more eyeballs → more ad inventory → more revenue. The strategy that has been more effective for them is (like news coverage, interpretive news) (like factual/data news, interest-based/informational news). most publications are still ad-supported augmenting high-complexity content with a ton of high volume, low-complexity content This strategy works because high-complexity content helps deliver long-term value to consumers, while the ton of low-complexity content helps . The SEO loop looks something like: high volume of content that gets clicks → search engines think your content is valuable → all of your content gets ranked higher → more eyeballs. get eyeballs as well as win the SEO game This is no criticism of the strategy and the need to play the SEO game is a necessity for ad-supported media. The reality is that — the internet disrupted how content was created and distributed (mostly through Google Search / today), and news organizations have not recovered from the impact of that disruption. There are attempts to fix the imbalance, which are still evolving — Canada/Australia passed laws that force Google/Meta to pay what’s essentially a “disruptor tax” to support good journalism, some organizations like NPR are partially supported by , and some newspapers like the Washington Post are . news media is a terrible business Meta federal funding subsidized by (generally well-meaning) billionaires All this to say — news media/journalism is an absolutely essential public utility for a well-functioning democracy but a not-so-great business. Therefore, the more self-reliant these news businesses can be (without having to depend on regulation or billionaires), the more effective they can be towards achieving their mission. Generative AI can’t solve all of these structural challenges (especially content distribution) but it can definitely make content creation more efficient without necessarily compromising on quality. The anatomy of producing a news article To understand what part of news production will generative AI have the most impact on, it’s helpful to understand the different steps involved in getting a news article published. We can break down the effort into a few sequential components: Research — finding a topic, gathering facts/data, talking to the right people for quotes or perspectives Storytelling — making sense of the research to come up with a compelling storyline Writing — turning the storyline into actual words that make an article, buttoning up the storyline, backing it up with the right data / adding supporting links Editing — improving the writing, coming up with catchier headlines, having better visuals, and fact-checking to meet standards Distribution — publishing, and distributing across channels like social media. Based on some research and also influenced by my writing experience, I estimate the effort of producing an article into something like: . Take the actual numbers with a grain of salt but they are directionally accurate. Research (30%), Storytelling (20%), Writing (20%), Editing (20%), and Distribution (10%) Now, note that — the low-complexity pieces might not need to rigorously go through all steps in the life cycle above but the high-complexity pieces do. not all formats of news articles require all of the steps As an example, this article took me ~8–9 hours to finish (so did most other articles on ), and I would like to think that my articles fall under interpretive news. If I wrote a low-complexity piece, I could probably get it done in ~2 hours. Another data point — says he can typically get a news article done in a couple of hours while a feature piece might take up to 6 months. my Substack newsletter this NYT reporter So, what can generative AI actually help with? It basically comes down to what steps in the news production process can current (and future) products do well. What generative AI can and cannot do well Here’s my take on each step. Spoiler — they are somewhat effective for writing and editing, they can be effective for research if the right products are built, and they will continue to be bad at storytelling. Research — surprisingly low capability Most current generative AI products (like ChatGPT, and Google Bard) have surprisingly low capability when it comes to Research: There are definitely certain capabilities that they are good at. For example, they are good at giving arguments for a particular point of view or providing inspiration for new topics. They are average-to-good at summarizing content and in particular, answering questions based on reading an article. For example, you can ask them to read this article and list out different steps involved in news production. However, they often produce (“hallucinations”), to what they claim is the truth, and have questionably sourced data with potential copyright infringement. See the screenshot below. factually incorrect information do not provide links/sources For a generic use case (say you want to draft an email to a future LinkedIn connection), these issues don’t matter. But when you are writing a news article, not fact-checking can severely impair your brand perception. Though the research tools can be used for directionally useful research (for example, you want to know how much market share Bing and Yahoo search have), writers/journalists still have to do additional work to find a new source to link because current tools neither provide links nor have fully accurate data. for anyone building a research product for writers, and it’s very likely that new companies will emerge here. Using cleanly sourced data + being able to provide answers with trustworthy links is a big opportunity Storytelling — low capability Generative AI’s storytelling capabilities are fairly weak today. Here’s an example: I did a bunch of research for this article, put together the research in an organized format, and asked ChatGPT to give me a storyline. See the screenshot below for results. At first glance, it looks like they “make sense”. But that’s literally all it is — it makes sense at a surface level. In reality, none of these storylines are very compelling and the research notes I provided had much more detail and nuance beyond the surface-level results provided here. You can make the argument that these are still decent, but in the context of writing an article, this was completely useless to me — at best, this was inspiration/ideas, not a storyline based on the research I submitted. If you have a low-complexity story, it will get the job done for you. If you are building a nuanced story, or have the data and need help constructing a story, current products do not get the job done. Given the high amount of subjectivity involved, I am not bullish it will get better and this will continue to be the part where writers can add the most value. Writing — medium capability If you provide current products with a detailed storyline of what you want to say, it can generate a barely decent v1 of the content. The output is still pretty cookie-cutter and it is pretty challenging to instruct the current models to craft the language in a way that it tells a story. See the screenshot for an example output after I fed ChatGPT detailed notes about the storyline for this article. At first glance, you might think it looks okay for a v1 draft. It is not — the tone isn’t right, the story doesn’t flow and it always looks like it’s been written by a bot. It’s very generic and does not articulate the story despite being fed a very specific narrative. If I published that article, you would not read it. And that’s the challenge with the writing capability today — it can work for low-complexity articles but for anything more complex, you essentially have to rewrite the whole draft. — writers don’t want to take terrible cookie-cutter versions and redo the whole thing line by line. What they would like is some form of a user interaction construct that lets a writer feed in a storyline and sequentially craft the article section by section, while giving active feedback to the AI tool. Cherry on top would be being able to customize the writing style by feeding past articles written by the same writer. The big product unlock here would be enabling effective human instruction I think the underlying models today do have the capability to do this and there is , which I believe will happen near-term. innovation needed at the UI layer Editing — medium capability Tools today have a good amount of capability to review articles, find errors and make corrections. These tools are also very good at cosmetic tasks, like coming up with ideas for catchy headlines or section titles that might perform well. However, there is still work needed at the UI layer to make this usable for editing — there are some partial solutions today like which lets you improve language and make sentences shorter / longer from within a Notion page, but it does not capture the full context of the page. ChatGPT does a good job of making edits across a full article but lacks the ability to take instructions to easily edit specific sections and also cannot support links (i.e. I give it a blurb with text that has hyperlinks, I get back text without any links). Notion AI I absolutely hate the editing part of the writing process, and I am sure several writers and journalists do as well — generative AI can most definitely minimize some of this editing grunt work near-term. Distribution — medium capability There are tools coming up here today that for example help you generate social snippets, or identify parts of your story that might go more viral. This will likely continue getting better in the future. Generative AI and the future of News — A tale of two worlds Based on the above analysis, you can see a clear duality emerging: , which require simpler research \\u0026 storytelling, and can be written \\u0026 edited easily, will start to be (or heavily AI-assisted). Low-complexity formats more and more AI-generated , which require more complex research and storytelling capabilities that don’t exist today, will but generative AI can bring a good amount of High-complexity formats continue to be primarily created by journalists efficiency by minimizing writing and editing gruntwork. While AI-generated low-complexity content seems bad at first glance, these articles are primarily written for SEO purposes or to augment existing high-quality content, and the race to commoditization had started much before the generative AI wave. For example, the Associated Press has been using since 2014. The upside here — this is not the kind of content journalists want to spend time creating and automating this will free up their time for high-complexity content. bots to publish articles reporting company earnings More and more high-complexity content will emerge. Research and storytelling capabilities with products today are limited, which means that the ability to . This, accelerated by AI writing and editing tools that take the grunt work out of publishing quality content, will be a big boon for journalists. construct a compelling story based on information and story-tell in a unique way will continue to be the biggest currency journalists have What about some of the concerns raised around using AI for news? Some are fair but I believe they are mostly solvable: A wave of junk SEO content — Google has that they won’t penalize AI-generated content and have gotten criticism for opening up a world of junk content, including factually incorrect articles. That’s a somewhat fair critique but I believe Google will crack down on this — not out of the goodness of their hearts but because the crux of a search product is to give users useful results. Google already has penalties for SEO hacking practices (like keyword stuffing, and link farming) and it would be easy to extend this framework to AI content. taken the stance Journalists will lose jobs — Some have brought up the concern that journalists might lose jobs, or be in a less advantageous position (like writers in Hollywood who are currently on strike); the big difference here is that while there are a large number of writers in Hollywood, newsroom employment in the US since 2008, not because we don’t need journalists but because news is a bad business; Generative AI can help fix the economics of the business while continuing to empower journalists do what they love. has fallen 26% Conclusion I am by no means an AI maximalist and I absolutely think there are real risks to AI that need to be addressed as we scale the technology. However, I think it’s important to analyze every AI-impacted market/situation separately and not bundle them into one big AI-impact problem. In the case of news, generative AI can tremendously improve the economics of news businesses. The products are not there today — there is a clear need for AI products that thoughtfully solve writers’ needs without a brute-force, chat-based, language model interface, but I’m confident these will emerge near-term. Low-complexity writing will be more and more AI generated and that’s okay — it can help companies run an efficient SEO machine, while journalists (assisted by AI for grunt work) bring to life a lot more high complexity content that elevates the public discourse.

With this in mind, let’s talk about how news makes money.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eThe business of news\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe business of news is tricky — most news organizations operate on an ad-supported media model, and a small subset have successfully managed to pivot to subscriptions. This has major implications for the type of content a news organization produces.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThe \\u003cstrong\\u003esubscription-based news\\u003c/strong\\u003e businesses (NYTimes notably now gets \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/business/media/new-york-times-earnings.html\\\"\\u003e~70% of revenue\\u003c/a\\u003e from subscriptions) have a content strategy that’s tied directly to consumer value — focus on \\u003cstrong\\u003ehigh-quality content + diverse interest-based content\\u003c/strong\\u003e to make the subscription worthwhile. For example, of the types of content above, NYT primarily does news coverage (that is well-researched), interpretive news, and feature pieces for their core news offering, backed up by interest-based content like \\u003cstrong\\u003eNYT Cooking\\u003c/strong\\u003e and \\u003cstrong\\u003eWirecutter\\u003c/strong\\u003e. Some other publications like the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have made strides with subscriptions using a similar approach.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eHowever, \\u003cstrong\\u003emost publications are still ad-supported\\u003c/strong\\u003e and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. This means that they are focused on generating high engagement: more eyeballs → more ad inventory → more revenue. The strategy that has been more effective for them is \\u003cstrong\\u003eaugmenting high-complexity content\\u003c/strong\\u003e (like news coverage, interpretive news) \\u003cstrong\\u003ewith a ton of high volume, low-complexity content\\u003c/strong\\u003e (like factual/data news, interest-based/informational news).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThis strategy works because high-complexity content helps deliver long-term value to consumers, while the ton of low-complexity content helps \\u003cstrong\\u003eget eyeballs as well as win the SEO game\\u003c/strong\\u003e. The SEO loop looks something like: high volume of content that gets clicks → search engines think your content is valuable → all of your content gets ranked higher → more eyeballs.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThis is no criticism of the strategy and the need to play the SEO game is a necessity for ad-supported media. The reality is that \\u003cstrong\\u003enews media is a terrible business\\u003c/strong\\u003e — the internet disrupted how content was created and distributed (mostly through Google Search / \\u003ca href=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/company/meta\\\"\\u003eMeta\\u003c/a\\u003e today), and news organizations have not recovered from the impact of that disruption. There are attempts to fix the imbalance, which are still evolving — Canada/Australia passed laws that force Google/Meta to pay what’s essentially a “disruptor tax” to support good journalism, some organizations like NPR are partially supported by \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances\\\"\\u003efederal funding\\u003c/a\\u003e, and some newspapers like the Washington Post are \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html\\\"\\u003esubsidized by (generally well-meaning) billionaires\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAll this to say — news media/journalism is an absolutely essential public utility for a well-functioning democracy but a not-so-great business. Therefore, the more self-reliant these news businesses can be (without having to depend on regulation or billionaires), the more effective they can be towards achieving their mission. Generative AI can’t solve all of these structural challenges (especially content distribution) but it can definitely make content creation more efficient without necessarily compromising on quality.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eThe anatomy of producing a news article\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTo understand what part of news production will generative AI have the most impact on, it’s helpful to understand the different steps involved in getting a news article published.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWe can break down the effort into a few sequential components:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eResearch — finding a topic, gathering facts/data, talking to the right people for quotes or perspectives\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eStorytelling — making sense of the research to come up with a compelling storyline\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eWriting — turning the storyline into actual words that make an article, buttoning up the storyline, backing it up with the right data / adding supporting links\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eEditing — improving the writing, coming up with catchier headlines, having better visuals, and fact-checking to meet standards\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDistribution — publishing, and distributing across channels like social media.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eBased on some research and also influenced by my writing experience, I estimate the effort of producing an article into something like: \\u003cstrong\\u003eResearch (30%), Storytelling (20%), Writing (20%), Editing (20%), and Distribution (10%)\\u003c/strong\\u003e.

For example, the Associated Press has been using \\u003ca href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/the-ap-is-using-robots-to-write-earnings-reports/\\\"\\u003ebots to publish articles reporting company earnings\\u003c/a\\u003e since 2014. The upside here — this is not the kind of content journalists want to spend time creating and automating this will free up their time for high-complexity content.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eMore and more high-complexity content will emerge. Research and storytelling capabilities with products today are limited, which means that the ability to \\u003cstrong\\u003econstruct a compelling story based on information and story-tell in a unique way will continue to be the biggest currency journalists have\\u003c/strong\\u003e. This, accelerated by AI writing and editing tools that take the grunt work out of publishing quality content, will be a big boon for journalists.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhat about some of the concerns raised around using AI for news? Some are fair but I believe they are mostly solvable:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA wave of junk SEO content — Google has \\u003ca href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content\\\"\\u003etaken the stance\\u003c/a\\u003e that they won’t penalize AI-generated content and have gotten criticism for opening up a world of junk content, including factually incorrect articles. That’s a somewhat fair critique but I believe Google will crack down on this — not out of the goodness of their hearts but because the crux of a search product is to give users useful results. Google already has penalties for SEO hacking practices (like keyword stuffing, and link farming) and it would be easy to extend this framework to AI content.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJournalists will lose jobs — Some have brought up the concern that journalists might lose jobs, or be in a less advantageous position (like writers in Hollywood who are currently on strike); the big difference here is that while there are a large number of writers in Hollywood, newsroom employment in the US \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/\\\"\\u003ehas fallen 26%\\u003c/a\\u003e since 2008, not because we don’t need journalists but because news is a bad business; Generative AI can help fix the economics of the business while continuing to empower journalists do what they love.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConclusion\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI am by no means an AI maximalist and I absolutely think there are real risks to AI that need to be addressed as we scale the technology. However, I think it’s important to analyze every AI-impacted market/situation separately and not bundle them into one big AI-impact problem.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eIn the case of news, generative AI can tremendously improve the economics of news businesses. The products are not there today — there is a clear need for AI products that thoughtfully solve writers’ needs without a brute-force, chat-based, language model interface, but I’m confident these will emerge near-term.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eLow-complexity writing will be more and more AI generated and that’s okay — it can help companies run an efficient SEO machine, while journalists (assisted by AI for grunt work) bring to life a lot more high complexity content that elevates the public discourse.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003chr\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThank you for reading!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"notice notice-info\\\"\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAlso published \\u003ca href=\\\"https://thisisunpacked.substack.com/p/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-news\\\"\\u003ehere.\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"profile\":{\"about_page_settings\":{\"owner\":\"RslbrPJJMpVSoCm5D7gzfEIZtz83\",\"createdAt\":\"2023-07-30T22:46:08.007Z\",\"blocked\":false,\"style\":{\"layout\":0,\"skin\":0,\"headline_pos\":\"center\"},\"published\":true,\"updatedAt\":\"2023-07-31T04:09:49.712Z\"},\"avatar\":\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/RslbrPJJMpVSoCm5D7gzfEIZtz83-gc93u21.jpeg\",\"bio\":\"Product person at heart.

is all the rage these days. It's often like having a super-smart, creative assistant that can write code, design logos and even pen a romantic sonnet, if you wish.</p>\n\n<p>But let's get real, readers. Generative AI isn't just for fun and games. It has the potential to change industries, from healthcare to finance. Look at <a href=\"https://www.genaitoday.ai/topics/genai-today/articles/460465-conversicas-latest-platform-upgrade-offers-flexible-ai-driven.htm\">Conversica's latest platform upgrade.</a> Or look at <a href=\"https://www.genaitoday.ai/topics/genai-today/articles/460499-telus-offers-customers-control-with-asynchronous-messaging.htm\">AI-powered asynchronous messaging offered by TELUS</a>.</p>\n <div class=\"small-sidebar-ad\">\n\n <!-- /1003160/120x600 -->\n<div id=\"div-tmcmid\" style=\"height:600px; width:120px; \"></div>\n\t \t\t\t\t\n \n</div> \n\n\n<p>Of course, those aren’t the only two things happening around GenAI. So let’s take a look at recent developments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GenAI on Motorola Phones</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/\">Motorola</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud</a> partnered to bring GenAI to Motorola phones, starting with the new razr series. Moto ai, powered by Google Cloud's Vertex AI, Gemini and Imagen models, offers enhanced features like task completion, suggestions, summaries, and more. Moto ai aims to transform the smartphone experience by being context-aware, personal and collaborative. The partnership has produced two main features: Magic Canvas and Style Sync. Moto ai will continue to learn and add new features like personalized summaries, conversation transcription and information recall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Relic and NVIDIA NIM Accelerate AI Adoption and ROI</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newrelic.com/\">New Relic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/\">NVIDIA NIM</a> partnered to simplify the development, deployment and monitoring of GenAI apps. New Relic AI monitoring provides visibility across the AI stack for applications built with NVIDIA NIM, enhancing data security and accelerating AI adoption. This integration helps organizations achieve faster ROI and gain a competitive edge in the AI race. Key features include full AI stack visibility, deep trace insights, model inventory, model comparison, deep GPU insights and enhanced data security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>eSentire's GenAI Visibility Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/\">eSentire</a>, an MDR provider, launched a GenAI visibility solution that provides daily insights into an organization's GenAI usage, including most used applications, users, prompts, and files shared. With this information, security leaders measure the organizational risks that come with GenAI and stay compliant with corporate policies.</p>\n\n<p>The solution offers a daily reporting dashboard to improve visibility, strengthen policy adherence, identify risks and understand emerging GenAI trends. This builds upon eSentire's previous AI-powered SOC and customer use cases and is made possible by its Atlas XDR platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unqork Introduces GenAI Connector</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unqork.com/\">Unqork</a>, an Enterprise App Cloud, introduced a new GenAI Connector to simplify the integration of third-party AI tools and accelerate the development of AI-driven applications.</p>\n\n<p>The GenAI Connector offers a solution to the challenges faced by organizations in integrating AI, such as delayed development, increased security risks and technical debt. Unqork's platform addresses these issues by providing a secure, scalable, and future-proof environment for AI development.</p>\n\n<p>The GenAI Connector supports popular platforms like OpenAI and GoogleAI, and handles all maintenance aspects, allowing customers to focus on innovation. Additionally, the Quarterly Platform Release introduces new features like Published Application Versioning, Data-Centric Development, Vega Tables and Operations Builder to enhance collaboration and data-centric development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HCLTech and IBM’s Generative AI Center of Excellence</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hcltech.com/\">HCLTech</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en\">IBM</a> partnered to establish a Generative AI Center of Excellence. This center will use IBM's watsonx platform to help businesses modernize applications, manage IT services and develop AI solutions. The CoE will also offer training for HCLTech and client engineers on AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p>You know the cliche. With great power comes great responsibility. As GenAI becomes more sophisticated, we need to be mindful of its potential biases and ethical implications. But for now, let's just sit back and enjoy the ride. After all, who doesn't love a little bit of AI-powered magic in their lives?</p>\n\n<p><em>Learn more about the latest trends and developments in the Generative AI space at </em><a href=\"http://www.generativeaiexpo.com/\"><em>Generative AI Expo</em></a><em>, taking place February 11-13, 2025 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

It encompasses a range of practices, tools, and workflows aimed at streamlining the development and deployment of ML models, ensuring their scalability, reliability, and performance in real-world applications.</p> <p>Unlike generative AI in DevOps, which specifically refers to the application of generative models within the DevOps domain, MLops goes beyond the use of generative models. While MLops can involve the utilization of generative AI techniques for tasks like data augmentation or synthetic data generation, its scope is much broader.</p> <p>MLops involves the entire lifecycle of Machine Learning models, including data preparation, model training, validation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. It focuses on enabling efficient collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and operations teams to ensure seamless integration of ML models into production systems.</p> <h2 id=\"How-Does-Generative-AI-Work-in-DevOps\">How Does Generative AI Work in DevOps?</h2> <p>Generative AI in DevOps combines the power of artificial intelligence technologies with the principles of DevOps, enabling <a href=\"../../../devops-outsourcing-services\">teams</a> to automate various stages of the software development and deployment process. From code generation to testing, monitoring, and even troubleshooting, Generative AI brings a new level of speed, accuracy, and scalability to DevOps practices.</p> <p>However, achieving success in this approach necessitates meticulous planning and a comprehensive grasp of both DevOps and AI concepts.</p> <h2 id=\"Benefits-of-AI-in-DevOps\">Benefits of AI in DevOps</h2> <p>By leveraging Generative AI, organizations can unlock numerous benefits in their software development lifecycle.</p> <p>Improved application performance, proactive detection and resolution of operational issues, real-time threat detection, smoother collaboration among teams, and continuous monitoring of code quality are just a few examples of the advantages that Generative AI brings to DevOps.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"lazy zooomable\" data-src=\"../../../media/images/Articles/Generative_AI_in_DevOps_Article/pic_5_AI_DevOps.png\" alt=\"Benefits of Generative AI in DevOps  Optimized Application Performance  Faster Time-to-Market  Automation  Real-Time Threat Detection  Quick Response to Issues  Improved Quality\" width=\"1200\" height=\"835\" style=\"height: auto;\"></p> <h3 id=\"Optimized-Application-Performance\">Optimized Application Performance</h3> <p>By automating repetitive tasks and analyzing vast amounts of data, AI empowers the DevOps team with faster and more precise decision-making capabilities.</p> <p>Within the DevOps domain, AI can be leveraged to create predictive analytics models that forecast system performance, leading to optimized application performance.</p> <h3 id=\"Faster-Time-to-Market\">Faster Time-to-Market</h3> <p>With&nbsp;automation and improved accuracy, DevOps teams can deliver software faster while maintaining high quality. This not only enables organizations to stay ahead in competitive markets but also allows them to respond quickly to customer demands and adapt to rapidly changing business needs.</p> <h3 id=\"Automation\">Automation</h3> <p>AI-driven automation and&nbsp;<a href=\"../../../cicd-consulting-services\">CI/CD</a> streamline the entirety of the DevOps process, encompassing testing, deployment, and beyond. It eliminates the need for manual intervention in repetitive tasks like testing, debugging, and code generation. This reduction in workload allows DevOps teams to concentrate on high-value activities such as designing and developing innovative features.</p> <h3 id=\"Real-Time-Threat-Detection\">Real-Time Threat Detection</h3> <p>In the realm of DevOps security, AI plays a pivotal role in identifying and promptly addressing threats and vulnerabilities. By identifying abnormal behavioral patterns in applications, servers, and networks, AI can detect potential security risks in real-time. Integrating security checks into the DevOps pipeline ensures that applications are thoroughly secured prior to deployment.</p> <h3 id=\"Quick-Response-to-Issues\">Quick Response to Issues</h3> <p>Through the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, AI fosters seamless communication and collaboration among DevOps teams. By incorporating AI-powered chatbots, team members gain access to 24/7 support, assistance with common queries, and knowledge sharing capabilities, resulting in smoother and faster responses to issues.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"lazy zooomable\" data-src=\"../../../media/images/Articles/Generative_AI_in_DevOps_Article/pic_7_AI_DevOps.png\" alt=\"Everything around AI Chatbots\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1000\" style=\"height: auto;\"></p> <h3 id=\"Improved-Quality\">Improved Quality</h3> <p>AI within the DevOps landscape reduces manual errors and minimizes the necessity for human intervention. It accelerates development speed while enhancing code quality, ultimately saving time and reducing costs. Continuous monitoring facilitated by AI ensures that software development remains efficient and maintains a high level of quality.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\" id=\"Predictive-vs-Reactive-Operations\"><strong>Predictive vs. Reactive Operations</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Perhaps the most transformative benefit of AI in DevOps is the fundamental shift from reactive to predictive operations. This change represents a quantum leap in how teams approach system reliability and incident management.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">In traditional reactive models, monitoring tools would alert engineers when something broke—a server went down, response times spiked, or an error rate exceeded thresholds. By the time the alert fired, users were already experiencing problems, and teams scrambled to diagnose and fix issues under pressure.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">AI-powered predictive systems flip this model entirely. By continuously analyzing patterns in system behavior, resource utilization, and application performance, these systems can forecast potential failures hours or even days in advance. Machine learning algorithms identify subtle anomalies and trends that human operators would miss, enabling teams to address issues before they impact production.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Real-time optimization takes this even further. AI systems don't just predict problems; they automatically remediate them. When an AI model detects that a microservice is experiencing memory pressure that will lead to an out-of-memory crash in 30 minutes, it can automatically scale resources, restart instances, or adjust traffic routing to prevent the issue entirely, often without any human intervention.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">This shift has measurably improved operational outcomes. Organizations implementing AI-enhanced DevOps workflows report a <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/technology/generative-ai/\">30% reduction</a> in deployment failures and a 20% improvement in deployment speed. Perhaps more importantly, many incidents are prevented entirely, never making it into these statistic calculations at all because they're resolved before users notice anything wrong.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">The predictive approach also changes team culture. Instead of constantly firefighting and responding to emergencies, DevOps engineers can focus on strategic improvements, architecture optimization, and innovation. This not only improves system reliability but also reduces burnout and improves job satisfaction for technical teams.</p> <p></p><div class=\"article-banner desc\" data-url=\"https://softjourn.com/devops-implementation-services\"> <div class=\"title-link-banner-gradient banner-wrap\"> <div class=\"row\"> <div class=\"col-md-12 article-content\"> <div class=\"title\"> Need Help With DevOps Implementation?

The expenses associated with AI systems pose a significant challenge for organizations seeking to adopt AI-enabled DevOps, making it unaffordable for many.</p> <h3 id=\"Stringent-Data-Privacy-Laws\">Stringent Data Privacy Laws</h3> <p>The implementation of robust data privacy regulations poses another obstacle. AI-enabled DevOps relies heavily on data, yet in numerous jurisdictions, laws governing personal data protection prohibit companies from collecting, processing, and utilizing personal data for analysis. Consequently, AI-enabled DevOps encounters significant challenges in accessing and analyzing data due to strict privacy regulations.</p> <h3 id=\"Out-of-Date-Information\">Out of Date Information</h3> <p>When you consider one of the most popular generative AI tools, ChatGPT, it is easy to understand why the outputted information is not flawless. ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff date varies by model, but for the current version, it is June 2024, which is now nearly two years behind.</p> <p>Additionally, ChatGPT lacks the ability to access real-time external resources, such as the web, rendering it a fixed repository of data from over a year ago.</p> <h3 id=\"Suboptimal-Solutions\">Suboptimal Solutions</h3> <p>A limitation of Generative AI in DevOps is the inherent risk of generating incorrect or suboptimal solutions. AI models are trained on historical data and patterns, which may not always capture the full complexity and context of real-world scenarios.</p> <h3 id=\"Human-Supervision-Necessary\">Human Supervision Necessary</h3> <p>While Generative AI brings significant advancements to the DevOps landscape, it is crucial to acknowledge the need for a skilled human overseer in the process. Despite the automation capabilities of Generative AI, human expertise remains invaluable for effective decision-making, quality control, and handling complex scenarios.</p> <p>A DevOps expert is essential to validate the outputs generated by Generative AI, ensuring that they align with the desired goals, industry best practices, and compliance requirements.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\" id=\"AI-Skills-Gap-and-Team-Burnout\"><strong>AI Skills Gap and Team Burnout</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">While AI promises to alleviate DevOps team workload, the transition itself presents significant challenges around skills and organizational change. DevOps teams are currently stretched thin, managing increasingly complex distributed systems while under pressure to deliver faster releases. This combination fuels burnout and turnover, creating a paradox: teams need AI to reduce their workload, but they lack the bandwidth to learn and implement it effectively.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Organizations face a critical choice: invest in upskilling their existing teams or risk falling behind as competitors adopt AI-driven workflows. However, training programs take time, and teams are already overburdened. This creates a challenging transition period where workload may actually increase before the benefits of AI automation are realized.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\"></p><div class=\"article-banner desc\" data-url=\"https://softjourn.com/insights/ai-coding-tools\"> <div class=\"text-image gradient banner-wrap\"> <div class=\" article-content\"> <div class=\"title\"> <div class=\"image\"> <img class=\"not-height\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"46\" height=\"44\" src=\"https://softjourn.com/images/icons/white_message.png\" alt=\"Can AI Really Code?

Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of AI Coding Tools </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p></p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\" id=\"The-Black-Box-Problem\"><strong>The Black Box Problem</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">A particular concern is the temptation to treat AI systems as \"black boxes\" - tools that magically work without needing to understand their inner workings. This approach is dangerous in DevOps, where understanding system behavior is crucial for troubleshooting and optimization. If engineers don't understand how AI models make decisions, they can't effectively validate outputs, debug issues, or optimize performance.</p> <h3 id=\"Not-Immune-to-Biases\">Not Immune to Biases</h3> <p>In the context of DevOps, generative AI models can pose significant limitations related to biases in the training data. DevOps processes increasingly rely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making, automation, and problem-solving. However, if the training data used to develop these generative models contains biases, those biases can propagate and impact critical decision-making processes within DevOps workflows.</p> <p>Biases in AI systems are notoriously difficult to quantify. When embedded prejudices exist in training data, they can manifest in how systems are built, deployed, and managed. AI tools fundamentally reflect the behavior and patterns they were trained on, making them inherently susceptible to the same biases present in their source data.</p> <p>This challenge is particularly acute for large language models used in DevOps. These models are trained on vast amounts of data scraped from the internet, which means they inevitably absorb the biases (both subtle and overt) that exist across online content. These biases can influence everything from code suggestions to infrastructure recommendations to incident prioritization.</p> <h3 id=\"Need-for-Continuous-Improvements\">Need for Continuous Improvements</h3> <p>As new technologies, frameworks, and security threats emerge, they must be continuously adapted and fine-tuned to stay relevant and effective. This means that your team must have the domain knowledge and experience to assess the performance of Generative AI models and make necessary adjustments to optimize their results.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"lazy zooomable\" data-src=\"../../../media/images/Articles/Generative_AI_in_DevOps_Article/pic_10_AI_DevOps.png\" alt=\"Top AI Tools for DevOps team\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" style=\"height: auto;\"></p> <h2 id=\"Top-AI-Tools-for-DevOps\">Top AI Tools for DevOps</h2> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">With the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into the DevOps process, a new generation of tools has emerged to streamline the development pipeline, reduce manual intervention, and proactively identify potential issues.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Here are the top AI-powered DevOps tools transforming the industry in 2025:</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"1-GitHub-Copilot\"><strong>1.

Are you aiming to reduce deployment failures? Improve security posture? Decrease incident response time? Optimize cloud costs? Choose AI solutions that directly address your organization's most pressing DevOps challenges and measure success against concrete business metrics.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"Prioritize-Data-Privacy-and-Security\"><strong>Prioritize Data Privacy and Security</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">AI systems require data to function, but not all data should be shared with AI models. Establish clear policies about what information can be input into AI systems, particularly when using external AI services. Avoid entering sensitive company information, proprietary code, customer data, or intellectual property into public AI models, as these inputs may be used to train the models and could potentially be leaked.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">For organizations in regulated industries—healthcare, <a href=\"../../../financial-software-development\">finance</a>, government—ensure AI tools comply with relevant frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and industry-specific requirements. Consider using private, on-premises, or dedicated AI deployments for handling sensitive data rather than public cloud services.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"Respect-Intellectual-Property-Rights\"><strong>Respect Intellectual Property Rights</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">AI-generated code and content raise complex intellectual property questions. Organizations must ensure that text, code, or other outputs generated by AI don't violate copyrights, patents, or licenses. This includes:</p> <ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7\"> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Verifying that AI-generated code doesn't inadvertently copy copyrighted code from training data</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Ensuring AI tools respect open-source licenses when suggesting code</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Establishing clear policies about ownership of AI-generated content</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Reviewing and understanding the terms of service for AI tools regarding IP rights</li> </ul> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Legal precedents for AI-generated content are still evolving, and companies should consult legal counsel when establishing AI usage policies.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"Implement-Robust-Validation-and-Human-Oversight\"><strong>Implement Robust Validation and Human Oversight</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">AI should augment human decision-making, not replace it entirely. Establish workflows where humans validate AI outputs before they impact production systems or customer-facing services. This is particularly critical for:</p> <ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7\"> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">AI-generated code being deployed to production</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Security recommendations and automated remediation actions</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Customer-facing chatbots and support systems</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Infrastructure changes suggested by AI optimization tools</li> </ul> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Because AI-generated content often \"reads like a human wrote it,\" it's easy to trust everything an AI system produces, even when it's inaccurate or incomplete. Teams must remain vigilant and skeptical, verifying information and validating outputs against known good practices and organizational standards.</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"Address-Bias-and-Fairness\"><strong>Address Bias and Fairness</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">AI models reflect the biases present in their training data. In DevOps contexts, this can manifest in various ways—from hiring tools that discriminate against certain candidates to monitoring systems that disproportionately flag certain types of services or teams. Organizations should:</p> <ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7\"> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Regularly audit AI systems for bias in outputs and decision-making</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Ensure diverse teams are involved in AI tool selection and implementation</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Establish feedback loops where users can report problematic AI behaviors</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Use AI governance tools that provide ongoing bias audits and transparency</li> <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Recognize that while bias can be minimized, it may never be completely eliminated</li> </ul> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">Industry expert, Oluwaniyi Darasimi, mentioned, \"<span style=\"color: #843fa1;\">human feedback is supposed to help mitigate bias, however, you need a very rigorous methodology - specifically, that the people providing feedback are from diverse enough backgrounds to ensure bases are covered in terms of bias.</span>\"</p> <h3 class=\"font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" id=\"Comply-with-Emerging-AI-Regulations\"><strong>Comply with Emerging AI Regulations</strong></h3> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words\">The regulatory landscape for AI is rapidly evolving.

In mid-2025, generative AI companies globally had already secured\n$69.6 billion\nin funding, with these numbers expected to rise by 2026.\nMeanwhile, the DevOps market has seen parallel expansion, reaching\n$14.95B in 2025\n, with a CAGR of 25.70% projected to reach $37.33B by 2029.\nIn this article, we will explore the exciting realm of Generative AI in DevOps, discussing its potential benefits, limitations, emerging trends, and best practices.\nJoin us as we explore the cutting-edge world of AI-enabled DevOps and discover how this powerful combination is reshaping the future of software engineering.\nIntroduction to Generative AI in DevOps\nWith the rise of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other GenAI tools, many businesses are now considering the best approaches to utilize AI to improve efficiency and save money.\nWhat is DevOps?\nLet's start with the basics, before jumping into the use of GenAI in DevOps.\nDevOps\nis a software development approach that focuses on fostering collaboration and integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.\nBy breaking down silos and promoting effective communication, DevOps aims to streamline the software development lifecycle. It encourages the use of automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment to achieve faster and more reliable software releases.\nDevOps also emphasizes the importance of\nagile principles\n, infrastructure as code, and close collaboration between various stakeholders, including developers, operations professionals, and quality assurance teams.\nThis approach enables organizations to deliver software products more efficiently, respond rapidly to changing business requirements, and further enhance security and overall customer satisfaction.\nRead more:\nHow Softjourn’s DevOps Team Saved Our Client Over $25k a Year on AWS\nGenerative AI vs. Artificial Intelligence\nAI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of technologies and methods that enable machines to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves developing algorithms and models that can process information, reason, learn from data, and make decisions or predictions.\nGenerative AI, on the other hand, is a specific subset or application of AI. It refers to the use of AI techniques to generate new and original content, such as images, texts, music, videos, and even coding. Generative AI models are designed to learn patterns and structures from training data and then use that knowledge to create new, realistic content that resembles the training data.\nGenerative AI utilizes deep learning algorithms, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to generate content that didn't exist in the training data.\nGenerative AI Models\nNoteworthy advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including mainstream image generation with Dall-E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, and Lensa, as well as conversational AI with ChatGPT, and code generation with Copilot.\nThe integration of larger transformer architectures, reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF), enhanced embeddings, and latent diffusion techniques has endowed these models with almost magical capabilities across a surprisingly diverse range of applications.\nLarge Language Model Advancements\nGenerative AI models have evolved dramatically. The latest iterations of GPT 5 and Gemini Ultra leverage multimodal capabilities, allowing for seamless integration of text, image, and even video generation within DevOps workflows. Tools like Copilot X now provide real-time coding suggestions based on live production environments, reducing errors and improving deployment speed.\nGenerative AI Tools: The Power and Pressure Game Is On -\nSource\nThe Rise of AIOps: When Artificial Intelligence Meets Operations\nThe most significant trend reshaping DevOps in 2026 is the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning into operational workflows—a practice known as AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations). This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from reactive to predictive operations.\nAIOps is no longer a futuristic concept but a present-day reality. The integration of AI and ML into DevOps workflows is enabling predictive monitoring, anomaly detection, and automation at an unprecedented scale.\nAccording to recent industry data,\n67%\nof DevOps teams have increased their investment in AI for DevOps in the last year alone, signaling a widespread recognition of its transformative potential.\nFrom Reactive to Predictive\nTraditional monitoring tools would alert teams when something broke; a reactive approach often meant scrambling to fix issues after they'd already impacted users.\nAI-powered systems flip this model entirely. They can predict failures before they occur, automatically remediate issues without human intervention, and optimize performance in real-time based on historical patterns and current conditions.\nThis predictive capability is transforming how teams approach system reliability and incident management. Instead of firefighting, DevOps engineers can focus on strategic improvements and innovation.\nAIOps platforms analyze vast amounts of operational data (logs, metrics, traces, and events) to identify patterns that would be impossible for humans to detect manually.\nThe Automation Imperative\nDevOps teams today are stretched thin and burning out under the weight of increasing system complexity and velocity demands. AI and automation offer a lifeline, helping teams win back time, tame complexity, and scale with confidence.\nBy 2026, DevOps engineers will spend significantly less time writing scripts from scratch and more time training AI systems to handle the heavy lifting of routine operational tasks.\nTools like GitHub Copilot and Datadog AI are already optimizing CI/CD pipelines and detecting anomalies automatically, reducing the cognitive load on human operators while improving reliability and speed.\nA Critical Inflection Point\nAIOps represents more than just another tool in the DevOps toolkit, as it's a fundamental reimagining of how software operations work. As systems become more distributed and complex, human-scale monitoring and management become untenable. AI fills this gap, providing the scalability and speed needed to manage modern cloud-native architectures effectively.\nFor organizations aiming to grow faster, safer, and smarter, embracing AIOps is essential for remaining competitive in an increasingly AI-driven landscape.\nHow is GenAI in DevOps Different from Machine Learning Operations (MLops)?\nMLops, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a discipline that focuses on the operational aspects of deploying, managing, and monitoring machine learning models in production environments. It encompasses a range of practices, tools, and workflows aimed at streamlining the development and deployment of ML models, ensuring their scalability, reliability, and performance in real-world applications.\nUnlike generative AI in DevOps, which specifically refers to the application of generative models within the DevOps domain, MLops goes beyond the use of generative models. While MLops can involve the utilization of generative AI techniques for tasks like data augmentation or synthetic data generation, its scope is much broader.\nMLops involves the entire lifecycle of Machine Learning models, including data preparation, model training, validation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. It focuses on enabling efficient collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and operations teams to ensure seamless integration of ML models into production systems.\nHow Does Generative AI Work in DevOps?\nGenerative AI in DevOps combines the power of artificial intelligence technologies with the principles of DevOps, enabling\nteams\nto automate various stages of the software development and deployment process. From code generation to testing, monitoring, and even troubleshooting, Generative AI brings a new level of speed, accuracy, and scalability to DevOps practices.\nHowever, achieving success in this approach necessitates meticulous planning and a comprehensive grasp of both DevOps and AI concepts.\nBenefits of AI in DevOps\nBy leveraging Generative AI, organizations can unlock numerous benefits in their software development lifecycle.\nImproved application performance, proactive detection and resolution of operational issues, real-time threat detection, smoother collaboration among teams, and continuous monitoring of code quality are just a few examples of the advantages that Generative AI brings to DevOps.\nOptimized Application Performance\nBy automating repetitive tasks and analyzing vast amounts of data, AI empowers the DevOps team with faster and more precise decision-making capabilities.\nWithin the DevOps domain, AI can be leveraged to create predictive analytics models that forecast system performance, leading to optimized application performance.\nFaster Time-to-Market\nWith automation and improved accuracy, DevOps teams can deliver software faster while maintaining high quality. This not only enables organizations to stay ahead in competitive markets but also allows them to respond quickly to customer demands and adapt to rapidly changing business needs.\nAutomation\nAI-driven automation and\nCI/CD\nstreamline the entirety of the DevOps process, encompassing testing, deployment, and beyond. It eliminates the need for manual intervention in repetitive tasks like testing, debugging, and code generation. This reduction in workload allows DevOps teams to concentrate on high-value activities such as designing and developing innovative features.\nReal-Time Threat Detection\nIn the realm of DevOps security, AI plays a pivotal role in identifying and promptly addressing threats and vulnerabilities. By identifying abnormal behavioral patterns in applications, servers, and networks, AI can detect potential security risks in real-time. Integrating security checks into the DevOps pipeline ensures that applications are thoroughly secured prior to deployment.\nQuick Response to Issues\nThrough the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, AI fosters seamless communication and collaboration among DevOps teams. By incorporating AI-powered chatbots, team members gain access to 24/7 support, assistance with common queries, and knowledge sharing capabilities, resulting in smoother and faster responses to issues.\nImproved Quality\nAI within the DevOps landscape reduces manual errors and minimizes the necessity for human intervention. It accelerates development speed while enhancing code quality, ultimately saving time and reducing costs. Continuous monitoring facilitated by AI ensures that software development remains efficient and maintains a high level of quality.\nPredictive vs. Reactive Operations\nPerhaps the most transformative benefit of AI in DevOps is the fundamental shift from reactive to predictive operations. This change represents a quantum leap in how teams approach system reliability and incident management.\nIn traditional reactive models, monitoring tools would alert engineers when something broke—a server went down, response times spiked, or an error rate exceeded thresholds. By the time the alert fired, users were already experiencing problems, and teams scrambled to diagnose and fix issues under pressure.\nAI-powered predictive systems flip this model entirely. By continuously analyzing patterns in system behavior, resource utilization, and application performance, these systems can forecast potential failures hours or even days in advance. Machine learning algorithms identify subtle anomalies and trends that human operators would miss, enabling teams to address issues before they impact production.\nReal-time optimization takes this even further. AI systems don't just predict problems; they automatically remediate them. When an AI model detects that a microservice is experiencing memory pressure that will lead to an out-of-memory crash in 30 minutes, it can automatically scale resources, restart instances, or adjust traffic routing to prevent the issue entirely, often without any human intervention.\nThis shift has measurably improved operational outcomes. Organizations implementing AI-enhanced DevOps workflows report a\n30% reduction\nin deployment failures and a 20% improvement in deployment speed. Perhaps more importantly, many incidents are prevented entirely, never making it into these statistic calculations at all because they're resolved before users notice anything wrong.\nThe predictive approach also changes team culture. Instead of constantly firefighting and responding to emergencies, DevOps engineers can focus on strategic improvements, architecture optimization, and innovation. This not only improves system reliability but also reduces burnout and improves job satisfaction for technical teams.\nNeed Help With DevOps Implementation? Our Experts can help!\nget in touch\nLimitations of AI for DevOps\nThe adoption of AI-enabled DevOps has gained popularity across organizations. However, it is essential to navigate the limitations and challenges associated with Generative artificial intelligence in DevOps.\nConsiderations such as the cost of\nimplementation\n, data privacy regulations, and the need for skilled personnel should be carefully addressed to ensure successful integration and optimal outcomes.\nImplementation Costs\nThe complete implementation of AI-enabled DevOps demands substantial investments in costly hardware, software, and skilled personnel. The expenses associated with AI systems pose a significant challenge for organizations seeking to adopt AI-enabled DevOps, making it unaffordable for many.\nStringent Data Privacy Laws\nThe implementation of robust data privacy regulations poses another obstacle. AI-enabled DevOps relies heavily on data, yet in numerous jurisdictions, laws governing personal data protection prohibit companies from collecting, processing, and utilizing personal data for analysis. Consequently, AI-enabled DevOps encounters significant challenges in accessing and analyzing data due to strict privacy regulations.\nOut of Date Information\nWhen you consider one of the most popular generative AI tools, ChatGPT, it is easy to understand why the outputted information is not flawless. ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff date varies by model, but for the current version, it is June 2024, which is now nearly two years behind.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT lacks the ability to access real-time external resources, such as the web, rendering it a fixed repository of data from over a year ago.\nSuboptimal Solutions\nA limitation of Generative AI in DevOps is the inherent risk of generating incorrect or suboptimal solutions. AI models are trained on historical data and patterns, which may not always capture the full complexity and context of real-world scenarios.\nHuman Supervision Necessary\nWhile Generative AI brings significant advancements to the DevOps landscape, it is crucial to acknowledge the need for a skilled human overseer in the process. Despite the automation capabilities of Generative AI, human expertise remains invaluable for effective decision-making, quality control, and handling complex scenarios.\nA DevOps expert is essential to validate the outputs generated by Generative AI, ensuring that they align with the desired goals, industry best practices, and compliance requirements.\nAI Skills Gap and Team Burnout\nWhile AI promises to alleviate DevOps team workload, the transition itself presents significant challenges around skills and organizational change. DevOps teams are currently stretched thin, managing increasingly complex distributed systems while under pressure to deliver faster releases. This combination fuels burnout and turnover, creating a paradox: teams need AI to reduce their workload, but they lack the bandwidth to learn and implement it effectively.\nOrganizations face a critical choice: invest in upskilling their existing teams or risk falling behind as competitors adopt AI-driven workflows. However, training programs take time, and teams are already overburdened. This creates a challenging transition period where workload may actually increase before the benefits of AI automation are realized.\nRead more:\nCan AI Really Code? Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of AI Coding Tools\nThe Black Box Problem\nA particular concern is the temptation to treat AI systems as \"black boxes\" - tools that magically work without needing to understand their inner workings. This approach is dangerous in DevOps, where understanding system behavior is crucial for troubleshooting and optimization. If engineers don't understand how AI models make decisions, they can't effectively validate outputs, debug issues, or optimize performance.\nNot Immune to Biases\nIn the context of DevOps, generative AI models can pose significant limitations related to biases in the training data. DevOps processes increasingly rely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making, automation, and problem-solving. However, if the training data used to develop these generative models contains biases, those biases can propagate and impact critical decision-making processes within DevOps workflows.\nBiases in AI systems are notoriously difficult to quantify. When embedded prejudices exist in training data, they can manifest in how systems are built, deployed, and managed. AI tools fundamentally reflect the behavior and patterns they were trained on, making them inherently susceptible to the same biases present in their source data.\nThis challenge is particularly acute for large language models used in DevOps. These models are trained on vast amounts of data scraped from the internet, which means they inevitably absorb the biases (both subtle and overt) that exist across online content. These biases can influence everything from code suggestions to infrastructure recommendations to incident prioritization.\nNeed for Continuous Improvements\nAs new technologies, frameworks, and security threats emerge, they must be continuously adapted and fine-tuned to stay relevant and effective. This means that your team must have the domain knowledge and experience to assess the performance of Generative AI models and make necessary adjustments to optimize their results.\nTop AI Tools for DevOps\nWith the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into the DevOps process, a new generation of tools has emerged to streamline the development pipeline, reduce manual intervention, and proactively identify potential issues.\nHere are the top AI-powered DevOps tools transforming the industry in 2025:\n1.

Generative AI offers a solution by automating initial troubleshooting, extracting insights from complex data, and streamlining remediation coordination.\nWith the ability to determine real problems and their root causes, generative approaches hold promise for improving incident management and reducing downtime in cloud application troubleshooting.\nAI in Observability and Monitoring\nGenerative AI now plays a pivotal role in observability platforms like Datadog and New Relic, automatically correlating logs, traces, and metrics to predict and resolve outages before they occur. This has led to a 40% improvement in MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) across major cloud environments.\nAdvanced Chaos Engineering\nChaos engineering emerged at Netflix with the\nChaos Monkey\ntool, which intentionally attacked different parts of their application to test real-time responses and remediation efforts.\nOpen-source tools like Litmus, ChaosBlade, and Chaos Mesh have expanded this approach. However, these methods have limitations in terms of generic attack classes and slow, manual remediation processes, hampering the overall improvement loop.\nGenerative approaches, leveraging modern transformers and automation capabilities, hold promise in increasing the quantity and quality of meaningful situations and automating remediation. This will accelerate the learning loop, enhance robustness, and show initial advancements in 2026.\nAI-Preventative DevOps Hiring Tools\nTo mitigate the risk of unqualified DevOps engineers leveraging generative AI to pass hiring tests and certifications, evaluation tools have emerged as a solution. These tools, such as\nlive-broken tests\n, have been specifically designed to assess the essential day-to-day skills of a DevOps engineer.

Are you aiming to reduce deployment failures? Improve security posture? Decrease incident response time? Optimize cloud costs? Choose AI solutions that directly address your organization's most pressing DevOps challenges and measure success against concrete business metrics.\nPrioritize Data Privacy and Security\nAI systems require data to function, but not all data should be shared with AI models. Establish clear policies about what information can be input into AI systems, particularly when using external AI services. Avoid entering sensitive company information, proprietary code, customer data, or intellectual property into public AI models, as these inputs may be used to train the models and could potentially be leaked.\nFor organizations in regulated industries—healthcare,\nfinance\n, government—ensure AI tools comply with relevant frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and industry-specific requirements. Consider using private, on-premises, or dedicated AI deployments for handling sensitive data rather than public cloud services.\nRespect Intellectual Property Rights\nAI-generated code and content raise complex intellectual property questions. Organizations must ensure that text, code, or other outputs generated by AI don't violate copyrights, patents, or licenses. This includes:\nVerifying that AI-generated code doesn't inadvertently copy copyrighted code from training data\nEnsuring AI tools respect open-source licenses when suggesting code\nEstablishing clear policies about ownership of AI-generated content\nReviewing and understanding the terms of service for AI tools regarding IP rights\nLegal precedents for AI-generated content are still evolving, and companies should consult legal counsel when establishing AI usage policies.\nImplement Robust Validation and Human Oversight\nAI should augment human decision-making, not replace it entirely. Establish workflows where humans validate AI outputs before they impact production systems or customer-facing services. This is particularly critical for:\nAI-generated code being deployed to production\nSecurity recommendations and automated remediation actions\nCustomer-facing chatbots and support systems\nInfrastructure changes suggested by AI optimization tools\nBecause AI-generated content often \"reads like a human wrote it,\" it's easy to trust everything an AI system produces, even when it's inaccurate or incomplete. Teams must remain vigilant and skeptical, verifying information and validating outputs against known good practices and organizational standards.\nAddress Bias and Fairness\nAI models reflect the biases present in their training data. In DevOps contexts, this can manifest in various ways—from hiring tools that discriminate against certain candidates to monitoring systems that disproportionately flag certain types of services or teams. Organizations should:\nRegularly audit AI systems for bias in outputs and decision-making\nEnsure diverse teams are involved in AI tool selection and implementation\nEstablish feedback loops where users can report problematic AI behaviors\nUse AI governance tools that provide ongoing bias audits and transparency\nRecognize that while bias can be minimized, it may never be completely eliminated\nIndustry expert, Oluwaniyi Darasimi, mentioned, \"\nhuman feedback is supposed to help mitigate bias, however, you need a very rigorous methodology - specifically, that the people providing feedback are from diverse enough backgrounds to ensure bases are covered in terms of bias.\n\"\nComply with Emerging AI Regulations\nThe regulatory landscape for AI is rapidly evolving. In 2026, frameworks like the\nEU AI Act\nand the\nAI Accountability Framework\nin the United States require organizations to conduct algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs) and maintain transparency about AI system use.\nStay informed about regulations in your jurisdiction and industry, and build compliance into your AI implementation from the start rather than retrofitting it later.\nAssemble Cross-Functional Teams\nAI implementation in DevOps shouldn't be a purely technical decision. Assemble cross-functional teams including:\nDevOps engineers\nwho understand operational needs\nSecurity professionals who can assess risks\nLegal and compliance experts who understand regulatory requirements\nData scientists or ML engineers who understand AI capabilities and limitations\nThis team should collaborate to determine the best use cases for AI, which company policies may be affected, what ethical standards should guide AI use, and how to monitor and govern AI systems over time.\nStart Small and Scale Gradually\nRather than attempting to transform your entire DevOps workflow with AI overnight, start with pilot projects in constrained environments. This allows teams to learn, make mistakes safely, and build expertise before rolling out AI tools more broadly. Choose initial use cases that are:\nWell-defined with clear success metrics\nLower risk if something goes wrong\nLikely to demonstrate value quickly\nRepresentative of broader use cases you'll tackle later\nInvest in Training and Upskilling\nAI literacy is becoming a core competency for DevOps professionals. Invest in comprehensive training programs that help teams understand:\nAI and machine learning fundamentals\nSpecific AI tools being implemented in your organization\nHow to validate AI outputs and recognize limitations\nPrompt engineering and effective interaction with AI systems\nEthical considerations and bias recognition\nMonitor AI Systems Like Any Other Production System\nAI tools are not \"set and forget\" solutions. They require ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and refinement. Establish observability for AI systems just as you would for applications and infrastructure:\nTrack accuracy and error rates of AI predictions and recommendations\nMonitor for concept drift where AI performance degrades over time\nMeasure business impact and ROI of AI implementations\nCollect user feedback on AI tool usefulness and accuracy\nRegularly review and update AI models as your systems and practices evolve\nRecognize Limitations and Maintain Realistic Expectations\nAI is a powerful tool, but it's not magic. Set realistic expectations with stakeholders about what AI can and cannot do. Acknowledge that:\nAI systems will make mistakes and require human oversight\nImplementation takes time, resources, and cultural change\nInitial results may be underwhelming before optimization\nNot every DevOps task is suitable for AI automation\nAI augments human capabilities rather than replacing human judgment\nFoster a Culture of Responsible Innovation\nFinally, create an organizational culture that values both innovation and responsibility. Encourage teams to explore AI capabilities while maintaining healthy skepticism. Celebrate successful AI implementations while openly discussing failures and lessons learned. Make it safe to question AI recommendations and override them when human judgment suggests a different path.\nAs industry expert, Siddhartha Allen, aptly summarized: \"\nImplementing AI is a great way to be more efficient and effective at your tasks—do explore it, but recognize the limitations.\n\"\nFinal Word\nThe future of DevOps is AI-driven, and staying ahead requires expertise and a strategic approach.
